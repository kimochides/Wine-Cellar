            <p class="lg:w-2/3 mx-auto leading-relaxed text-base" style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif; color: #a53333">Wine 'n' Dine provides you with a food pairing recommendation chart. Food and wine pairing is the art of selecting wines that complement the flavors of a dish, aiming to create harmonious combinations. The goal is to enhance the dining experience by considering factors such as complementary flavors, contrasting textures, and the balance of intensity between the wine and the food.These tried-and-true wine and food combinations were practically made for each other.</p>

                  <p class="leading-relaxed" style="color: #302a1d; font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif">Cabernet Sauvignon, with its high tannin content, pairs seamlessly with steak as the fat in the meat softens the tannins and complements the wine's bold, fruity notes. For a delightful match, try grilled steak with American red Zinfandel or a tannic Merlot, and pan-fried steak with a fruitier red like Australian Shiraz or a Merlot from California, Oregon, or Washington offer a range of profiles.</p>

                  <h1 class="title-font text-lg font-medium mb-3" style="color: #5a1814; font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif">Soup and Stews with Pinot Noir</h1>
                  <p class="leading-relaxed" style="color: #302a1d; font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif">Pinot Noir is beloved for its silken texture and light-to-medium body, and it pairs well with hearty soups and stews, which have a similar feel. Additionally, pinot noirs have earthy undertones that highlight the medley of vegetables and herbs that make these dishes so flavorful and comforting. When served together, the combination is (almost) better than your favorite cozy sweater.</p>

                  <h1 class="title-font text-lg font-medium mb-3" style="color: #5a1814; font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif">Pizza and Barbera</h1>
                  <p class="leading-relaxed" style="color: #302a1d; font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif">Theres a saying in the wine business that “what grows together, goes together,” and it rings true when pizza is on the table. Italian wines from the Barbera grape are light- to medium-bodied and have high acidity, which complement rich, cheesy slices of pizza. The wines’ classic red fruit flavors also harmonize beautifully with traditional toppings like bell peppers, fennel-laced sausages, and mushrooms.</p>

                  <h1 class="title-font text-lg font-medium mb-3" style="color: #5a1814; font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif">Classic Pastas and Sangiovese</h1>
                  <p class="leading-relaxed" style="color: #302a1d; font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif">With traditional pasta dishes, few wines are as satisfying as an Italian Sangiovese (aka Chianti or Chianti Classico). These medium-to full-bodied reds beautifully accent fresh tomato sauces, robust Bolognese, baked ziti, or olive-oil based sauces. Sangiovese is known for its bright cherry flavors and herbal aromatics, which add intrigue and nuance when served alongside pastas of all kinds.</p>

                  <p class="leading-relaxed" style="color: #302a1d; font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif">When you're entertaining for the holidays, opt for a red and white wine that complements the diverse array of foods on your table. Focus on selecting wines with moderate tannins and high acidity. Consider white wine options such as Riesling, Sauvignon Blanc, or sparkling wine. On the red wine front, both Pinot Noir and Gamay make excellent choices.</p>

                  <p class="leading-relaxed" style="color: #302a1d; font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif">Slightly sweet, low-alcohol wines like German, Australian or New York Rieslings give the palate some relief from a spicy meal. A highly alcoholic wine would make you feel the burn.Similar pairings include Spicy Asian food or highly spiced Mexican dishes like enchiladas also pair well with Riesling. A dry Gewurztraminer also pairs well with heart-pumping cuisines like Thai or Indian.</p>
